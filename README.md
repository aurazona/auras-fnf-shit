# Aura's FNF shit

heyo, aurazona here.

this repo is where i'll be storing all of my fnf shit, so stuff like source code, assets, etc.

feel free to have a peek at my code to see how i did certain things, etc.

if you use any of my code, it'd be nice to get some credit somewhere, but it's no biggie if you don't.

also if you use any of my code in your project, get in contact with me at Aurazona#1337. i would probably like to play your mod.
